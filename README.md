# Analysis of Baseball Data

My graph is to help identify specific trend within four variables that determine what might give a player the edge when acheiving home runs.  The four variables are handedness, height, weight, and body_category.  What I am trying to predict is if there is a specific varible that would allow a player to have more homerun hits.  If we can determin what variable has the most success factors, the data could be useful for training techniques in acheiving higher homeruns for the team.
